# Tidy Thursdays

A repo to collate work done in our "Tidy Thursdays" workshops.

We usually announce new meetings on [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/) and work on [Tidy Tuesdays](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/) projects. We learn from each other, exchange the experiences, talk about R and have fun :)

The projects in this repo are organised by dates of our meeting.
